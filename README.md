Project Details:

The HR analytics project aimed at predicting employee attrition, an issue of significant concern in the business world. With over 4.25 million people leaving their jobs in the U.S. in January 2022, the cost of replacing employees is estimated to be 1.5 to 2 times their annual salary. The project underscores the importance of addressing attrition early to prevent long-lasting damage to organizations, citing contributors to employee burnout, such as unfair treatment, unmanageable workloads, and lack of role clarity.

The project utilized HR Analytics data from Kaggle, focusing on 14,999 observations and 10 features, including satisfaction levels, performance evaluations, number of projects, and more. The project's mission objectives were to provide insights and predictions to help company leadership mitigate attrition.

Four machine learning models were implemented, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy, followed by Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. Random Forest, despite its accuracy, was noted to potentially have an overfitting issue.

In conclusion, this analysis quantifies the performance of the machine learning models and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each, offering valuable insights for organizations to address and potentially reduce employee attrition.
